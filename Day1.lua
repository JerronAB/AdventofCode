input_text = '(((())))'

-- there are several ways to do this; not sure what's quickest
-- 1) have an integer that counts up or down while iterating through each character
-- 2) count all '(' and ')' characers, subtract. 
-- 2 seems more advanced so let's try it. 

function count_char(character,input_text)
    --body
end
